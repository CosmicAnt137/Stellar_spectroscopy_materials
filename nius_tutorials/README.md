## NIUS Astronomy Camp 2025 - Guided Tutorials

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks provided as part of guided hands-on
tutorial sessions during the NIUS Astronomy Camp 2025.

The notebooks were supplied by the instructors and used during the sessions
to explain the physical motivation, data analysis steps, and interpretation
of results. They are included here for reference and learning purposes.

I do not claim authorship of the original code. Any annotations or minor
