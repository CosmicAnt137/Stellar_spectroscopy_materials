## DSKC Summer Research Project – Area 6

This folder contains material related to my undergraduate summer research
project carried out collaboratively with a fellow undergraduate student as part of the DSKC Summer Research Programme.


### Project
**Physical Parameters of Stars in NGC 6397 Using Full-Spectrum Fitting**

The project involved exploring stellar atmospheric parameter estimation
(effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity) using full-spectrum
fitting techniques applied to archival spectroscopic data of the globular
cluster NGC 6397.

### Contents
- **Project report (PDF):** Undergraduate summer research report summarizing
  the motivation, methodology, analysis, and outcomes of the project.
- **Reference paper:** A research article consulted during the project for
  background and methodological understanding.

### Notes
- The project was conducted as a learning-focused research experience.
- The reference paper is included only for context and was not authored by me.
- We used UlySS which ran on IDL (interactive data language)
